Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Each input will have exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.the answer can be returned in any order.

Example Inputs & Outputs:

Example 1

Input:  nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]  
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9


Example 2

Input:  nums = [3,2,4], target = 6  
Output: [1,2]


Example 3

Input:  nums = [3,3], target = 6  
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^4

-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
